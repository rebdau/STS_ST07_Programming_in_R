Therefore, this course is organized as an R programming workshop. from the first session on, we will engage in executing specific tasks in R, while learning new parts of the R programming language every week. We will use a program called swirl to provide immediate assessment and helpful feedback in R as you work through the lessons.\nEach session will alternate between (1) a few swirl lessons of 15-20 min (2) a summary of the most important newly acquired aspects, some extra information, and best practice guidelines (3) an assignment that will repeat much of the material of the lesson, but with new data and without the feedback from swirl.\nPlease, make sure that you have, before the the start of our first session, R installed on your computer.\nYou will find some guidelines for the installation of R here. You can work directly in the R console or in RStudio. But in order to run swirl, you must have R 3.1.0 or later installed."
