# STS_ST07
STS ST07 "Programmation en R" - An introduction to R, taught to graduate students subscribed at the Science and Health Graduate school of Université de Picardie Jules Verne (UPJV), Amiens, France. This course covers basic material, adapted from the Swirl Course Network.
The course consists of Swirl lessons, alternated with exercises.

Swirl lessons
=============
Lessons are short (20–30 minute) scripts that run in the R console that each student works through independently.
These lessons will walk through R commands and ideas, providing direct real-time feedback as the student writes code in the R console.

Exercises
=========
The exercises will repeat much of the material of the swirl lessons, but with new data and without the feedback from SWIRL. The exercises will reinforce the material adressed in Swirl lessons, and develop understanding and coding skills.
