car	price(EUR)	consumption(L/100km)
A	8000		18.9
B	8700		15.7
C	9900		12.4
D	10500		14.1

John rides on average 20000 km per year, and the price of the fuel is on average 1.9 EUR/L

Create an object called km, which contains the average distance driven per year by John.
Create an object called euro.liter, which contains the price of the fuel per liter
Create an object called price, which is a vector of length 4 containing the prices of the cars
Create an object called consumption, which is a vector of length 4 containing the consumption of the cars in L per 100 km

In a single command, create an object called cost, which is a vector of length 4 containing the cost of each car for John, in the first year, taking into account the purchase and the fuel costs.
Which car costs the least in the first year?
